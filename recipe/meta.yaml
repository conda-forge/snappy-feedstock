  patches:
    # Have snappy-unittest not run the slow-ish microbenchmarks, but just
    # the quick correctness tests, without bothering with gflags (which didn't
    # work out of the box). This is the recommended method in the README.
    - skip-microbenchmarks.patch
    # Name the static library snappy_static.lib on windows, to distinguish from
    # the dynamic library, since they have the same suffix there.
